# Pomodoro-Clock
An Embedded Project of a customizable pomodoro clock using servo's to denote Work, Rest, Edit and Cycle Completed through Arduino. Using Platform.IO via VSCode.

## To Do
* [] Optimize Code (IMPORTANT)
  *   [] Helper Library 
  *   [] Button Library
  *   [] Display Library (Maybe have specific lcd screen functions here to then use as display)
  *   [] Basic Servo Library made via PWM

* [] Add "LOCKED IN" Button, continous cycle no breaks. Make have it as a switch... Prolly more funnier using a switch,
  
* [] Plan via Perfboard
* [] CAD case
* [] Solder connections
* [] 3D Print Case
